- 👋 Hi, I’m @vykintasmylimas, an ambitious begginer programmer who is planning to make a career out of it!
- 👀 I’m interested in game making, programming in C++, pixel art, programming concepts and computers in general.
- 🌱 Currently learning C++, planning on learning Java next, really trying to look into algorithms, really want to do pixel art well.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game making projects, anything that would help me learn programming!
- 📫 You can message me on discord (𝒷𝓁𝑜𝑜𝒹𝓎#4601), open to different types of communicating!
